# 2nd-keyboard
Autohotkey scripts to allow for using a second keyboard as a pure macro keyboard which I pulled from [Taran's Github](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/tree/master/Razer "Taran's Original Github") and changed it to work for my Blackwidow Chroma. 

The macro.synapse3 is the Synapse profile I made, with static red lighting and a simple white ripple effect when a key is pressed. It incorporates all of the macro keys into Taran's script.

As time goes on, I will be adding my own scripts to this repository, so you will probably want to pull from the initial commit, which I made the mistake of having two of. You'll want the second, which you can view [here](https://github.com/r-hurtado/2nd-keyboard/tree/d35db14763e3588bd1b318643e2531aa314e3ef4 "Initial commit").

I also changed the tray icon to a computer chip instead of a tree. If you want to change it, choose a different number from Taran's helpfully provided [chart](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/INFO_and_PROFILES/system32-shell32_dll.png "Icon chart").
From there, change the number on line 21 of Razer_macro_keyboard.ahk to the one you've chosen and reload the script.
